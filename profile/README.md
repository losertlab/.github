## Hi there 👋

![The most recent group photo from the lab website.](GroupPhoto-MostUpdated.jpg)

🙋‍♀️ We work on emergent dynamical properties of complex systems at the convergence of physics, materials science, and biology. 

Our main research topics are

- ⏳ Granular dynamics
- 🦠 Biodynamics
- :dna: Cancer dynamics
- :brain: Crowd coding of the brain
- :microscope: Understanding and Controlling the Coupled Electrical, Chemical, & Mechanical Excitable Networks of Living Systems
