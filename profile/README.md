🙋‍♀️ We work on emergent dynamical properties of complex systems at the convergence of physics, materials science, and biology. 

Our main research topics are

- Granular dynamics
- Biodynamics
- Cancer dynamics
- Crowd coding of the brain :brain:
- Understanding and Controlling the Coupled Electrical, Chemical, & Mechanical Excitable Networks of Living Systems
